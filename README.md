## Notes

Please make a full backup of your site and Markdown content prior to running any scripts.

These scripts are provided by the community in the hope that they might aid updating and managing large collections of Markdown content. Before running a script, you should review its code and adapt it as necessary for your content.

Windows users may need to install the [Windows Linux Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) in order to run Bash scripts.
