# Hugo Assistant

**A collection of scripts to help migrate content to new versions of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).**

## Notes

Please make a full backup of your site prior to running any scripts.

These scripts are provided in the hope that they might aid updating and managing Hugo/Academic based sites. Before running a script, you should review its code and adapt it as necessary for your site.

Windows users may need to install the [Windows Linux Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) in order to run Bash scripts.
